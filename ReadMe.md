# Tweet-Scrolls: Twitter Archive JSON to CSV / TXT

*"Ah, my dear friend from the Tech Part of Twitter..."*

## A Word from the Headmaster

Welcome, accomplished practitioner of the digital arts. I trust your timeline has been treating you well, though I suspect—as is often the case with the most curious minds—you find yourself drowning in a sea of your own Twitter archives, much like a first-year student lost in the ever-changing staircases of Hogwarts.

Fear not, for Tweet-Scrolls shall serve as your most reliable House-elf in this endeavor. This Rust-crafted tool, while perhaps lacking the dramatic flair of a phoenix feather wand, possesses a magic all its own: the remarkable ability to transform your chaotic collection of JSON tweets into perfectly organized conversation threads.

Much like how the Sorting Hat peers into the essence of each student to place them in their proper house, Tweet-Scrolls examines each of your tweets with similar discernment, threading together conversations with the methodical precision that would make even Professor McGonagall nod in approval.

## What This Tool Offers

- **Thread Weaving**: Connects reply chains into complete conversations, rather like following the silver thread of a memory through a Pensieve
- **Scholarly Filtering**: Removes the noise of retweets, keeping only the substantial discourse—your original thoughts and meaningful replies
- **Temporal Organization**: Arranges your threads chronologically, newest first, as time flows ever forward
- **Analytical Insight**: Provides metrics on engagement, because even in the wizarding world, numbers have their place
- **Dual Formats**: Outputs both CSV files for your spreadsheet sorcery and readable TXT files for leisurely perusal

## Requirements for This Magic

You will need Rust and Cargo installed upon your machine. The good folks at [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) can assist you in this preliminary step.

## Casting the Spell

```bash
git clone https://github.com/that-in-rust/tweet-scrolls.git
cd tweet-scrolls
cargo run
```

## Simple Instructions

1. Place your Twitter JSON archive file within the project directory
2. Execute `cargo run` with the confidence of a seventh-year casting their first Patronus
3. Await the completion of the process—patience, as always, yields the finest results
4. Discover your organized threads in the newly created CSV and TXT files

## Final Thoughts

Remember, my dear TPOT dweller, that even the most brilliant minds benefit from organization. Your thoughts, scattered though they may seem across the vast expanse of Twitter, possess patterns and connections that this humble tool shall help illuminate.

May your threads be ever coherent, and your engagement metrics ever ascending.

*"Happiness can be found even in the darkest of tweet storms, if one only remembers to organize one's digital life."*
